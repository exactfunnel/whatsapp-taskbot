## üöÄ Bypass Solution - Quick WhatsApp Setup

If Facebook Business Manager continues to have issues:

2. **Use web interface** for task management
3. **Add WhatsApp later** when account issues resolved

## üß™ Test Your Bot Without WhatsApp (Temporary)

While fixing Facebook issues, test your bot:

```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://whatsapp.skyroofingconstructiontx.co/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
    "entry": [{
      "changes": [{
        "value": {
          "messages": [{
            "from": "1234567890",
            "text": {"body": "help"}
          }]
        }
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

This tests if your bot logic works without WhatsApp connection.
